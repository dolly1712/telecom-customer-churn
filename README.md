# Telecom Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Overview
This project revolves around exploratory data analysis (EDA) of telecom customer churn data. Exploratory data analysis is a critical phase in any data science project, involving the initial investigation of the data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and formulate hypotheses. In the context of telecom customer churn, EDA helps in understanding the characteristics of churned and non-churned customers, identifying potential predictors of churn, and gaining insights to guide subsequent modeling efforts.

# Motivation
Understanding customer churn is crucial for telecom companies to develop effective retention strategies and maintain profitability. Exploratory data analysis plays a fundamental role in this process by providing insights into the underlying patterns and factors influencing customer churn.

# Data
The dataset used in this project comprises historical customer data obtained from the Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A. . It includes various features such as demographic information, usage patterns, service subscriptions, and churn status.

# Problem Statement
Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The exploratory data analysis phase involves:
• Summarizing the main characteristics of the data through descriptive statistics.
• Visualizing the distribution of key variables using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
• Exploring relationships between variables through scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.
• Analyzing the impact of different features on customer churn using bar plots, heatmaps, and pivot tables.

# Conclusion
1. Higher churn rates are observed among customers with a higher number of customer service calls, indicating dissatisfaction.
2. Customers with international plans tend to churn at a higher rate compared to those without, suggesting the need for improved international service offerings.
3. Churn rates vary across different states, indicating potential regional factors influencing customer retention.
4. Customers with higher total day minutes, calls, and charges exhibit higher churn rates, suggesting dissatisfaction with daytime service usage.
5. The presence of a voice mail plan does not significantly impact churn rates, suggesting it may not be a significant factor in customer retention.
6. Churn rates tend to be higher among customers with longer account lengths, indicating that loyalty doesn't always guarantee retention
7. Evening and night usage patterns do not show a strong correlation with churn, indicating that service quality during these times may not significantly impact customer retention.

# Recommendation
1. Implement proactive customer service strategies to address concerns raised by high call volume customers.
2. Enhance international plan features and offerings to improve customer retention.
3. Tailor marketing and service strategies to address regional differences in churn rates.
4. Consider optimizing voice mail plan offerings to better align with customer needs.
5. Take feedback from customers to enhance service quality and address pain points effectively.
6. Implement improved marketing strategies to attract new customers, focusing on clear communication and value propositions
7. Provide tailored offers to long-term customers, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.
